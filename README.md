__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
Problem Introduction: Computing the Minimum Cost of a Flight
<br/>
<br/>
Now, you are interested in minimizing not the number of segments, but the total cost of a flight. For this
you construct a weighted graph: the weight of an edge from one city to another one is the cost of the
corresponding flight.
<br/>
<br/>
Task: Given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges as well as two
vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣, compute the weight of a shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 (that is, the minimum total
weight of a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣).
<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣.
<br/>
<br/>
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 104, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 105, 𝑢 ̸= 𝑣, 1 ≤ 𝑢, 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛, edge weights are non-negative integers not
exceeding 103.
<br/>
<br/>
Output Format.: Output the minimum weight of a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣, or −1 if there is no path.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)"
